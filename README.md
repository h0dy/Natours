Practice website for learning advanced CSS&Sass. Coded along as part of the Udemy course "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/)
in this project, I used Flexbox instead of Float Layouts (which was taught in this project) because in the current year, everybody is moving away from float-based layout and replacing it with Flexbox and Grid
